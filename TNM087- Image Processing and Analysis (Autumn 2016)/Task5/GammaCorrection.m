function GImage = GammaCorrection( OImage, Gamma, Lower, Upper )
%GammaCorrection Implement gamma correction
%   Truncate the original gray values using lower and upper quantiles
%   (Lower, Upper) and then apply gamma correction with exponent Gamma to input
%   image OImage, the result is the double image GImage with maximum gray
%   value one

%% Syntax of the function
%
%   Input arguments:
%       OImage: RGB image of type uint8 or double
%       Gamma: exponent used in the gamma correction, 
%       'GImage = OImage^Gamma'
%       Lower: value in the range 0, 1
%       Upper: value in the range 0, 1 and lower < upper
%       Lower and Upper are quantile values. 
%   Output argument: GImage: gamma corrected gray value image of type double

%% Basic version control (in case you need more than one attempt)
%
% Version: 1
% Date: 2016-12-06
%
% Gives a history of your submission to Lisam.
% Version and date for this function have to be updated before each
% submission to Lisam (in case you need more than one attempt)
%
%% General rules
%
% 1) Don't change the structure of the template by removing %% lines
%
% 2) Document what you are doing using comments
%
% 3) Before submitting make the code readable by using automatic indentation
%       ctrl-a / ctrl-i
%
% 4) In case a task requires that you have to submit more than one function
%       save every function in a single file and collect all of them in a
%       zip-archive and upload that to Lisam. NO RAR, NO GZ, ONLY ZIP!
%       All non-zip archives will be rejected automatically
%
% 5) Often you must do something else between the given commands in the
%       template
%
%

%% Image size and result allocation
%
[sx,sy,nc] = size(OImage);

%Convert to double, scales values to the range 0-1.
OImage = im2double(OImage);

%% Lower and upper gray value boundaries
%
lowgv = quantile(OImage(:),Lower);
uppgv = quantile(OImage(:),Upper);

%% Compute a scaled version GImage of the image where 
% the lower-bound gray value is zero 
% the upper-bound gray value is one 
% because 0^Gamma = 0 and 1^Gamma = 1

% Cut off all pixels from min to lowgv, and from uppgv to max.
omax = max(OImage(:));
omin = min(OImage(:));
GImage = (OImage-lowgv)/(uppgv-lowgv);

% To avoid complex numbers.
GImage(GImage<0) = 0;
GImage(GImage>1) = 1;
%% Actual mapping of the previous result 
%
GImage = GImage.^Gamma; %mapping

imshow(GImage);
